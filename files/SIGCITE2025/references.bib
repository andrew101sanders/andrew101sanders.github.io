Nowadays software systems place considerable importance to security concerns related to code flaws that lead to software vulnerabilities. In this paper, we present a study to identify the relationship between code smells and vulnerabilities in software code. Our study provides information about the impact of code smells on software security and considers open source implementation of technologies under the Apache Tomcat software. The results show the relationship between the code smells and the security vulnerabilities. While most code smells, have a slight impact, one particular smell is identified to have a more considerable impact.},

  abstract = {Vulnerabilities in Android code -- including but not limited to insecure data storage, unprotected inter-component communication, broken TLS implementations, and violations of least privilege -- have enabled real-world privacy leaks and motivated research cataloguing their prevalence and impact. Researchers have speculated that appification promotes security problems, as it increasingly allows inexperienced laymen to develop complex and sensitive apps. Anecdotally, Internet resources such as Stack Overflow are blamed for promoting insecure solutions that are naively copy-pasted by inexperienced developers. In this paper, we for the first time systematically analyzed how the use of information resources impacts code security. We first surveyed 295 app developers who have published in the Google Play market concerning how they use resources to solve security-related problems. Based on the survey results, we conducted a lab study with 54 Android developers (students and professionals), in which participants wrote security-and privacy-relevant code under time constraints. The participants were assigned to one of four conditions: free choice of resources, Stack Overflow only, official Android documentation only, or books only. Those participants who were allowed to use only Stack Overflow produced significantly less secure code than those using, the official Android documentation or books, while participants using the official Android documentation produced significantly less functional code than those using Stack Overflow. To assess the quality of Stack Overflow as a resource, we surveyed the 139 threads our participants accessed during the study, finding that only 25\% of them were helpful in solving the assigned tasks and only 17\% of them contained secure code snippets. In order to obtain ground truth concerning the prevalence of the secure and insecure code our participants wrote in the lab study, we statically analyzed a random sample of 200,000 apps from Google Play, finding that 93.6\% of the apps used at least one of the API calls our participants used during our study. We also found that many of the security errors made by our participants also appear in the wild, possibly also originating in the use of Stack Overflow to solve programming problems. Taken together, our results confirm that API documentation is secure but hard to use, while informal documentation such as Stack Overflow is more accessible but often leads to insecurity. Given time constraints and economic pressures, we can expect that Android developers will continue to choose those resources that are easiest to use, therefore, our results firmly establish the need for secure-but-usable documentation.},

This assessment requires to consider multiple factors (technical features, operational environment, involved assets, status of the vulnerability lifecycle, etc.) and may depend from the assessor's knowledge and skills. In this work, we tackle with an important part of this problem by measuring the accuracy of               technical               vulnerability assessments by assessors with different level and type of knowledge. We report an experiment to compare how accurately students with different technical education and security professionals are able to assess the severity of software vulnerabilities with the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (v3) industry methodology. Our results could be useful for increasing awareness about the intrinsic subtleties of vulnerability risk assessment and possibly better compliance with regulations. With respect to academic education, professional training and human resources selections our work suggests that measuring the effects of knowledge and expertise on the accuracy of software security assessments is feasible albeit not easy.},

  abstract = {Research efforts tried to expose students to security topics early in the undergraduate CS curriculum. However, such efforts are rarely adopted in practice and remain less effective when it comes to writing secure code. In our prior work [18], we identified key issues with the how students code and grouped them into six themes: (a) Knowledge of C, (b) Understanding compiler and OS messages, (c) Utilization of resources, (d) Knowledge of memory, (e) Awareness of unsafe functions, and (f) Understanding of security topics. In this work, we aim to understand students' knowledge about each theme and how that knowledge affects their secure coding practices. Thus, we propose a modified SOLO taxonomy for the latter five themes. We apply the taxonomy to the coding interview data of 21 students from two US R1 universities. Our results suggest that most students have limited knowledge of each theme. We also show that scoring low in these themes correlates with why students fail to write secure code and identify possible vulnerabilities.},

This is one of the first introductory courses where students can learn about security and the need for robust coding. However, currently, these courses are taught with a focus on functionality and efficiency only, ignoring security almost entirely.In this paper, we provide a basic security analysis of computer systems courses from 16 of the top 20 CS undergraduate programs at R1 universities in the US. We collected more than 760 thousand lines of C/C++ code written by 253 students and used by instructors in lectures and for assignments. We found students frequently use unsafe functions such as strcpy, strcat, and system, many of which can lead to serious security vulnerabilities. These unsafe functions are present in course materials such as in lecture slides and textbooks, and even in the code provided by instructors. We also show a high correlation between the unsafe functions used by students with those used by their instructors.},

  abstract = {We present a neural model for representing snippets of code as continuous distributed vectors (``code embeddings''). The main idea is to represent a code snippet as a single fixed-length code vector, which can be used to predict semantic properties of the snippet. To this end, code is first decomposed to a collection of paths in its abstract syntax tree. Then, the network learns the atomic representation of each path while simultaneously learning how to aggregate a set of them.  We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by using it to predict a method's name from the vector representation of its body. We evaluate our approach by training a model on a dataset of 12M methods. We show that code vectors trained on this dataset can predict method names from files that were unobserved during training. Furthermore, we show that our model learns useful method name vectors that capture semantic similarities, combinations, and analogies.  A comparison of our approach to previous techniques over the same dataset shows an improvement of more than 75\%, making it the first to successfully predict method names based on a large, cross-project corpus. Our trained model, visualizations and vector similarities are available as an interactive online demo at http://code2vec.org.

In-depth, high-intensity types of intervention may be more effective for female students. Background: Instructional interventions are being developed to address both the critical shortage in cybersecurity talent and gender gaps in the cyber workforce. These interventions need rigorous evaluation. Specific types of instructional strategies are particularly effective for STEM learning. Also, gender differences are found in the benefit students derive from certain instructional methods. An important question is whether certain instructional methods are particularly effective for cybersecurity learning, and consistent in both male and female students. Research Questions: Do cybersecurity interventions affect problem-solving, cybersecurity engagement, and/or cybersecurity self-efficacy? Are there gender differences in terms of intervention effectiveness? Methodology: Study 1 ( \$n{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}, =\$ 79) included a 60-min workshop model where participants, assigned to treatment and control groups, completed surveys pre- and post-intervention. The treatment group experienced a workshop on computer networking, without any technology. The control group did not receive the workshop. Study 2 ( \$n{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash},=\$ 34) was a week-long intervention whose participants had formal lessons, built websites, and defended themselves from an ongoing simulated cyberattack. Participants completed a survey on cybersecurity learning and engagement three times during the intervention. Findings: Study 1 showed no main treatment effect, but females experienced greater gains in problem-solving than males. In Study 2, there was positive growth over time and females experienced greater growth in cybersecurity self-efficacy relative to males.},

  abstract = {Over the last decade, there has been an increase in the number of attacks on web applications. The proliferation of these attacks is partially a result of increased adoption of IT systems in organisations and the increasing role digital technologies play in our lives. The success of an attack relies upon the existence of vulnerabilities in the code base and there is consensus within literature that many of these vulnerabilities can be avoided through developers adopting secure code practices and standards which are often not formally taught.Whilst gamification has been shown to be an effective educational tool in fields such as health, education and security awareness, there is a scarcity of research regarding the application of gamification in the context of secure code practices. This paper evaluates the efficacy of a bespoke gamified application in creating awareness and fostering an understanding of the threats and secure coding practices. The application presented in this work focuses on JavaScript with the aim of reducing the number of vulnerabilities in web applications. The analysis is conducted using first and second-year undergraduate participants, who are viewed as the primary target for this software.As part of a participant study involving the application, it was found that gamification elements were effective in increasing user engagement. Initial findings suggest potential for the integration of secure-code gamification in traditional pedagogical methods, but further investigation is required to strengthen this claim.},

Everyone has had problems with software like text editors that freeze, answering machines that won't answer. Others are far more serious, such as the program on a satellite that contains an error, causing the loss of expensive equipment, or Web servers that have bugs enabling an attacker to break in and steal personal data. In the case of medical equipment, poor software could cost lives. To develop a better software, one way is to make good programming as much a part of learning computer science as good writing is a part of studying English and law. To test this idea, a secure-programming clinic was developed. Principles of robust programming are widely taught in beginning and advanced programming courses. They're a large part of good programming style and require the realization that things can go wrong. A user might enter a string when the program expects an integer. A function that opens a file might fail. The program must check for these possibilities and handle them correctly. Grading in these programming courses takes such practices into account. But all too often in advanced computer science courses, students don't follow these practices.},

In the last decades, governmental and non-governmental organisations have become aware of this problem. However, the existing cybersecurity workforce has not been sufficient for satisfying the increasing demand for qualified cybersecurity professionals, and the shortfall will increase in the next years. Meanwhile, to address the increasing demand for cybersecurity professionals, academic institutions have been establishing cybersecurity programs, particularly, cybersecurity master programs. This paper aims at analysing which cybersecurity topics are covered by existing cybersecurity master programs of top universities and how these topics are distributed through courses. It starts by reviewing the evolution and maturation of the cybersecurity discipline, focusing on the ACM efforts, which include the early addition of the Information Assurance and Security Knowledge Areas to the computer science curricula and, more recently, the development of curricular recommendations to support the definition of post-secondary cybersecurity programs. These latest guidelines are used to analyse and review 21 cybersecurity master programs, focusing on the contents of their courses, structure, admission requirements, duration, requirements for completion, and evolution.},

  abstract = {We propose and release a new vulnerable source code dataset. We curate the dataset by crawling security issue websites, extracting vulnerability-fixing commits and source codes from the corresponding projects. Our new dataset contains 150 CWEs, 26,635 vulnerable functions, and 352,606 non-vulnerable functions extracted from 7,861 commits. Our dataset covers 305 more projects than all previous datasets combined. We show that increasing the diversity and volume of training data improves the performance of deep learning models for vulnerability detection. Combining our new dataset with previous datasets, we present an analysis of the challenges and promising research directions of using deep learning for detecting software vulnerabilities. We study 11 model architectures belonging to 4 families. Our results show that deep learning is still not ready for vulnerability detection, due to high false positive rate, low F1 score, and difficulty of detecting hard CWEs. In particular, we demonstrate an important generalization challenge for the deployment of deep learning-based models. However, we also identify hopeful future research directions. We demonstrate that large language models (LLMs) are the future for vulnerability detection, outperforming Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with manual feature engineering. Moreover, developing source code specific pre-training objectives is a promising research direction to improve the vulnerability detection performance.},

  abstract = {The feedback provided by current testing education tools about the deficiencies in a student's test suite either mimics industry code coverage tools or lists specific instructor test cases that are missing from the student's test suite. While useful in some sense, these types of feedback are akin to revealing the solution to the problem, which can inadvertently encourage students to pursue a trial-and-error approach to testing, rather than using a more systematic approach that encourages learning. In addition to not teaching students why their test suite is inadequate, this type of feedback may motivate students to become dependent on the feedback rather than thinking for themselves. To address this deficiency, there is an opportunity to investigate alternative feedback mechanisms that include a positive reinforcement of testing concepts. We argue that using an inquiry-based learning approach is better than simply providing the answers. To facilitate this type of learning, we present Testing Tutor, a web-based assignment submission platform that supports different levels of testing pedagogy via a customizable feedback engine. We evaluated the impact of the different types of feedback through an empirical study in two sophomore-level courses. We use Testing Tutor to provide students with different types of feedback, either traditional detailed code coverage feedback or inquiry-based learning conceptual feedback, and compare the effects. The results show that students that receive conceptual feedback had higher code coverage (by different measures), fewer redundant test cases, and higher programming grades than the students who receive traditional code coverage feedback.},

The first source consists of Programs of Study for cybersecurity programs at Centers of Academic Excellence in Cybersecurity designated by the National Security Agency. Statistics were aggregated from a sample of one hundred CAE-C institutions, trends and gaps are identified, and improvements are proposed. The second source is peer-reviewed research published in the field of cybersecurity education over the last decade. A review of this literature shows a strong focus on identifying instructional content and developing educational tools while simultaneously indicating a shortage of research into rigorous evaluation of the instructional approaches being used to teach cybersecurity. Our review of these two sources of data highlight two paths to improving cybersecurity education in the United States. First, institutions offering cybersecurity degrees could work more closely with groups such as NIST, ACM, and IEEE to ensure their curricula match the needs of industry and they are graduating work-ready cybersecurity specialists. While CAE-C designation provides certain requirements for the amount of cybersecurity content included in curricula, designated institutions vary widely in the types of programs they offer and how many cybersecurity-specific courses they provide. Second, cybersecurity education could benefit from an influx of ideas from educational psychology regarding instructional theories such as cognitive load theory.},

  abstract = {The use of learning-based techniques to achieve automated software vulnerability detection has been of longstanding interest within the software security domain. These data-driven solutions are enabled by large software vulnerability datasets used for training and benchmarking. However, we observe that the quality of the data powering these solutions is currently ill-considered, hindering the reliability and value of produced outcomes. Whilst awareness of software vulnerability data preparation challenges is growing, there has been little investigation into the potential negative impacts of software vulnerability data quality. For instance, we lack confirmation that vulnerability labels are correct or consistent. Our study seeks to address such shortcomings by inspecting five inherent data quality attributes for four state-of-the-art software vulnerability datasets and the subsequent impacts that issues can have on software vulnerability prediction models. Surprisingly, we found that all the analyzed datasets exhibit some data quality problems. In particular, we found 20-71\% of vulnerability labels to be inaccurate in real-world datasets, and 17-99\% of data points were duplicated. We observed that these issues could cause significant impacts on downstream models, either preventing effective model training or inflating benchmark performance. We advocate for the need to overcome such challenges. Our findings will enable better consideration and assessment of software vulnerability data quality in the future.},

  abstract = {Good coding style is recognised by the software engineering profession as being important, and this is reflected in the standard computing curricula. Feedback on some aspects of coding style is now commonly provided by IDEs and by tools such as Checkstyle, but this feedback focuses on coding standards that are largely based on syntax. However, some aspects of coding style relate to the semantics of code --- of the many ways to achieve some functionality, some are preferred because they are simpler, yet students struggle to create them. In this paper, we introduce the concept of semantic style, and in particular semantic style indicators that may be manifestations of poor knowledge of some programming concepts. We describe 16 semantic style indicators and demonstrate their prevalence in almost 19,000 code samples submitted by over 900 novice students. Half the students submitted code exhibiting two or more of these indicators, demonstrating the potential value to learn by providing feedback on semantic style. We also find many indicators are present in the code of students attending their fourth year of a highly competitive Software Engineering programme, demonstrating the need for more attention to teaching of semantic style issues.},

This struggle is caused by multiple factors: (1) it is challenging to effectively incorporate software testing into an already over-packed curriculum, (2) ad-hoc efforts to teach testing generally happen too late in the students' career, after bad habits have already been developed, and (3) these efforts lack the necessary institutional consistency and support to be effective. To address these challenges we created Bug Hunt, a web-based tutorial to engage students in learning software testing strategies. In this paper we describe the most interesting aspects of the tutorial including the lessons and feedback mechanisms, and the facilities for instructors to configure the tutorial and obtain automatic student assessment. We also present the lessons learned after two years of deployment.},

  abstract = {Online programming discussion platforms such as Stack Overflow serve as a rich source of information for software developers. Available information include vibrant discussions and oftentimes ready-to-use code snippets. Previous research identified Stack Overflow as one of the most important information sources developers rely on. Anecdotes report that software developers copy and paste code snippets from those information sources for convenience reasons. Such behavior results in a constant flow of community-provided code snippets into production software. To date, the impact of this behaviour on code security is unknown. We answer this highly important question by quantifying the proliferation of security-related code snippets from Stack Overflow in Android applications available on Google Play. Access to the rich source of information available on Stack Overflow including ready-to-use code snippets provides huge benefits for software developers. However, when it comes to code security there are some caveats to bear in mind: Due to the complex nature of code security, it is very difficult to provide ready-to-use and secure solutions for every problem. Hence, integrating a security-related code snippet from Stack Overflow into production software requires caution and expertise. Unsurprisingly, we observed insecure code snippets being copied into Android applications millions of users install from Google Play every day. To quantitatively evaluate the extent of this observation, we scanned Stack Overflow for code snippets and evaluated their security score using a stochastic gradient descent classifier. In order to identify code reuse in Android applications, we applied state-of-the-art static analysis. Our results are alarming: 15.4\% of the 1.3 million Android applications we analyzed, contained security-related code snippets from Stack Overflow. Out of these 97.9\% contain at least one insecure code snippet.},

The Code Defenders game addresses this problem by letting students compete over code under test by either introducing faults ("attacking") or by writing tests ("defending") to reveal these faults. In this paper, we describe how we integrated Code Defenders as a semester-long activity of an undergraduate and graduate level university course on software testing. We complemented the regular course sessions with weekly Code Defenders sessions, addressing challenges such as selecting suitable code to test, managing games, and assessing performance. Our experience and our data show that the integration of Code Defenders was well-received by students and led them to practice testing thoroughly. Positive learning effects are evident as student performance improved steadily throughout the semester.},

  abstract = {Software vulnerabilities are prevalent in software systems, causing a variety of problems including deadlock, information loss, or system failures. Thus, early predictions of software vulnerabilities are critically important in safety-critical software systems. Various ML/DL-based approaches have been proposed to predict vulnerabilities at the file/function/method level. Recently, IVDetect (a graph-based neural network) is proposed to predict vulnerabilities at the function level. Yet, the IVDetect approach is still inaccurate and coarse-grained. In this paper, we propose LINEVUL, a Transformer-based line-level vulnerability prediction approach in order to address several limitations of the state-of-the-art IVDetect approach. Through an empirical evaluation of a large-scale real-world dataset with 188k+ C/C++ functions, we show that LINEVUL achieves (1) 160\%-379\% higher F1-measure for function-level predictions; (2) 12\%-25\% higher Top-10 Accuracy for line-level predictions; and (3) 29\%-53\% less Effort@20\%Recall than the baseline approaches, highlighting the significant advancement of LINEVUL towards more accurate and more cost-effective line-level vulnerability predictions. Our additional analysis also shows that our LINEVUL is also very accurate (75\%-100\%) for predicting vulnerable functions affected by the Top-25 most dangerous CWEs, highlighting the potential impact of our LINEVUL in real-world usage scenarios.},

  abstract = {The detection of software vulnerability requires critical attention during the development phase to make it secure and less vulnerable. Vulnerable software always invites hackers to perform malicious activities and disrupt the operation of the software, which leads to millions in financial losses to software companies. In order to reduce the losses, there are many reliable and effective vulnerability detection systems introduced by security communities aiming to detect the software vulnerabilities as early as in the development or testing phases. To summarise the software vulnerability detection system, existing surveys discussed the conventional and data mining approaches. These approaches are widely used and mostly consist of traditional detection techniques. However, they lack discussion on the newly trending machine learning approaches, such as supervised learning and deep learning techniques. Furthermore, existing studies fail to discuss the growing research interest in the software vulnerability detection community throughout the years. With more discussion on this, we can predict and focus on what are the research problems in software vulnerability detection that need to be urgently addressed. Aiming to reduce these gaps, this paper presents the research interests' taxonomy in software vulnerability detection, such as methods, detection, features, code and dataset. The research interest categories exhibit current trends in software vulnerability detection. The analysis shows that there is considerable interest in addressing methods and detection problems, while only a few are interested in code and dataset problems. This indicates that there is still much work to be done in terms of code and dataset problems in the future. Furthermore, this paper extends the machine learning approaches taxonomy, which is used to detect the software vulnerabilities, like supervised learning, semi-supervised learning, ensemble learning and deep learning. Based on the analysis, supervised learning and deep learning approaches are trending in the software vulnerability detection community as these techniques are able to detect vulnerabilities such as buffer overflow, SQL injection and cross-site scripting effectively with a significant detection performance, up to 95\% of F1 score. Finally, this paper concludes with several discussions on potential future work in software vulnerability detection in terms of datasets, multi-vulnerabilities detection, transfer learning and real-world applications.},

One can draw a parallel between this model of thinking and techniques used in test-driven development, where students learn by thinking about how to effectively test their code and anticipate possible bugs. In this study, we analyzed the quality of both attack and defense code that students wrote for an assignment given in an introductory security class of 75 (both graduate and senior undergraduate levels) at NYU. We made several observations regarding students' behaviors and the quality of both their defensive and offensive code. We saw that student defensive programs (i.e., assignments) are highly unique and that their attack programs (i.e., test cases) are also relatively unique. In addition, we examined how student behaviors in writing defense programs correlated with their attack program's effectiveness. We found evidence that students who learn to write good defensive programs can write effective attack programs, but the converse is not true. While further exploration of causality is needed, our results indicate that a greater pedagogical emphasis on defensive security may benefit students more than one that emphasizes offense.},

  abstract = {Often, security topics are only taught in advanced computer science (CS) courses. However, most US R1 universities do not require students to take these courses to complete an undergraduate CS degree. As a result, students can graduate without learning about computer security and secure programming practices. To gauge students' knowledge and skills of secure programming, we conducted a coding interview with 21 students from two R1 universities in the United States. All the students in our study had at least taken Computer Systems or an equivalent course. We then analyzed the students' approach to safe programming practices, such as avoiding unsafe functions like gets and strcpy, and basic security knowledge, such as writing code that assumes user inputs can be malicious. Our results suggest that students lack the key fundamental skills to write secure programs. For example, students rarely pay attention to details, such as compiler warnings, and often do not read programming language documentation with care. Moreover, some students' understanding of memory layout is cursory, which is crucial for writing secure programs. We also found that some students are struggling with even the basics of C programming, even though it is the main language taught in Computer Systems courses.},

  abstract = {Background. Developers use Static Analysis Tools (SATs) to control for potential quality issues in source code, including defects and technical debt. Tool vendors have devised quite a number of tools, which makes it harder for practitioners to select the most suitable one for their needs. To better support developers, researchers have been conducting several studies on SATs to favor the understanding of their actual capabilities. Aims. Despite the work done so far, there is still a lack of knowledge regarding (1) what is their agreement, and (2) what is the precision of their recommendations. We aim at bridging this gap by proposing a large-scale comparison of six popular SATs for Java projects: Better Code Hub, CheckStyle, Coverity Scan, FindBugs, PMD, and SonarQube. Method. We analyze 47 Java projects applying 6 SATs. To assess their agreement, we compared them by manually analyzing - at line- and class-level - whether they identify the same issues. Finally, we evaluate the precision of the tools against a manually-defined ground truth. Results. The key results show little to no agreement among the tools and a low degree of precision. Conclusions. Our study provides the first overview on the agreement among different tools as well as an extensive analysis of their precision that can be used by researchers, practitioners, and tool vendors to map the current capabilities of the tools and envision possible improvements.},

  abstract = {The rapid expansion of software systems and the growing number of reported vulnerabilities have emphasized the importance of accurately identifying vulnerable code segments. Traditional methods for vulnerability localization, such as manual code audits or rule-based tools, are often time-consuming and limited in scope, typically focusing on specific programming languages or types of vulnerabilities. In recent years, the introduction of large language models (LLMs) such as GPT and LLaMA has opened new possibilities for automating vulnerability detection. However, while LLMs show promise in this area, they face challenges, particularly in maintaining accuracy over longer code contexts. This paper introduces LOVA, a novel framework leveraging the self-attention mechanisms inherent in LLMs to enhance vulnerability localization. Our key insight is that self-attention mechanisms assign varying importance to different parts of the input, making it possible to track how much attention the model focuses on specific lines of code. In the context of vulnerability localization, the hypothesis is that vulnerable lines of code will naturally attract higher attention weights because they have a greater influence on the model's output. By systematically tracking changes in attention weights and focusing on specific lines of code, LOVA improves the precision of identifying vulnerable lines across various programming languages. Through rigorous experimentation and evaluation, we demonstrate that LOVA significantly outperforms existing LLM-based approaches, achieving up to a 5.3x improvement in F1-scores. LOVA also demonstrated strong scalability, with up to a 14.6x improvement in smart contract vulnerability localization across languages like C, Python, Java, and Solidity. Its robustness was proven through consistent performance across different LLM architectures.},

In this study, we investigate the feasibility of employing GPT-3.5 from OpenAI, as an LLM teaching assistant (TA) or a virtual TA in computer science (CS) courses. The objective is to enhance the accessibility of CS education while maintaining academic integrity by refraining from providing direct solutions to current-semester assignments. Targeting Foundations of Programming (COMP202), an undergraduate course that introduces students to programming with Python, we have developed a virtual TA using the LangChain framework, known for integrating language models with diverse data sources and environments. The virtual TA assists students with their code and clarifies complex concepts. For homework questions, it is designed to guide students with hints rather than giving out direct solutions. We assessed its performance first through a qualitative evaluation, then a survey-based comparative analysis, using a mix of questions commonly asked on the COMP202 discussion board and questions created by the authors. Our preliminary results indicate that the virtual TA outperforms human TAs on clarity and engagement, matching them on accuracy when the question is non-assignment-specific, for which human TAs still proved more reliable. These findings suggest that while virtual TAs, leveraging the capabilities of LLMs, hold great promise towards making CS education experience more accessible and engaging, their optimal use necessitates human supervision. We conclude by identifying several directions that could be explored in future implementations.},

  abstract = {Automatically detecting software vulnerabilities is an important problem that has attracted much attention from the academic research community. However, existing vulnerability detectors still cannot achieve the vulnerability detection capability and the locating precision that would warrant their adoption for real-world use. In this paper, we present a vulnerability detector that can simultaneously achieve a high detection capability and a high locating precision, dubbed Vulnerability Deep learning-based Locator (VulDeeLocator). In the course of designing VulDeeLocator, we encounter difficulties including how to accommodate semantic relations between the definitions of types as well as macros and their uses across files, how to accommodate accurate control flows and variable define-use relations, and how to achieve high locating precision. We solve these difficulties by using two innovative ideas: (i) leveraging intermediate code to accommodate extra semantic information, and (ii) using the notion of granularity refinement to pin down locations of vulnerabilities. When applied to 200 files randomly selected from three real-world software products, VulDeeLocator detects 18 confirmed vulnerabilities (i.e., true-positives). Among them, 16 vulnerabilities correspond to known vulnerabilities; the other two are not reported in the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) but have been "silently" patched by the vendor of Libav when releasing newer versions.},

  abstract = {Open-source code hosted online at programming portals is present in 99\% of commercial software and is common practice among developers for rapid prototyping and cost-effective development. However, research reports the presence of vulnerabilities, which result in catastrophic security compromise, and the individual, organization, and even national secrecy are all victims of this circumstance. One of the frustrating aspects of vulnerabilities is that vulnerabilities manifest themselves in hidden ways that software developers are unaware of. One of the most critical tasks in ensuring software security is vulnerability detection, which jeopardizes core security concepts like integrity, authenticity, and availability. This study aims to explore security-related vulnerabilities in programming languages such as C, C++, and Java and present the disparities between them hosted at popular code repositories. To attain this purpose, 708 programs were examined by severity-based guidelines. A total of 1371 vulnerable codes were identified, of which 327 in C, 51 in C++, and 993 in Java. Statistical analysis also indicated a substantial difference between them, as there is ample evidence that the Kruskal-Wallis H-test p-value (.000) is below the 0.05 significance level. The Mann-Whitney Test mean rank for GitHub (Mean-rank=676.05) and Rosettacode (Mean-rank=608.64) are also different. The novelty of this article is to identify security vulnerabilities and grasp the nature severity of vulnerability in popular code repositories. This study eventually manifests a guideline for choosing a secure programming language as a successful testing technique that targets vulnerabilities more liable to breaching security.},

  abstract = {Nowadays, learning management systems (LMSs) are established tools in higher education, especially in the domain of software engineering (SE). However, the potential of such educational technologies has not been fully exploited, as student performance in SE education is still strongly dependent on feedback from time-constrained lecturers and tutors. Moreover, current LMSs are not designed for SE courses, as external SE tools are required to fulfill the requirements of lecturers such as programming and UML modeling features. Evolving these LMSs in the direction of intelligent tutoring could assist students in receiving automatic, individual feedback from the LMSs on their learning performance at any time. Also, gamified learning elements can serve to motivate students to engage with SE materials. Therefore, this paper presents an approach combining learning analytics, feedback, and interactive learning such as gamification in one LMS designed for SE education. The system could thus address diverse students with different backgrounds and motivational aspects and provide appropriate individual support to ensure effective SE education.},

However, a problem arises when this public code must manage authentication secrets, such as API keys or cryptographic secrets. These secrets must be kept private for security, yet common development practices like adding these secrets to code make accidental leakage frequent. In this paper, we present the first large-scale and longitudinal analysis of secret leakage on GitHub. We examine billions of files collected using two complementary approaches: a nearly six-month scan of real-time public GitHub commits and a public snapshot covering 13\% of open-source repositories. We focus on private key files and 11 high-impact platforms with distinctive API key formats. This focus allows us to develop conservative detection techniques that we manually and automatically evaluate to ensure accurate results. We find that not only is secret leakage pervasive --- affecting over 100,000 repositories --- but that thousands of new, unique secrets are leaked every day. We also use our data to explore possible root causes of leakage and to evaluate potential mitigation strategies. This work shows that secret leakage on public repository platforms is rampant and far from a solved problem, placing developers and services at persistent risk of compromise and abuse.},

We observed a wide adoption of the authentication and authorization features provided by Spring Security---a third-party framework designed to secure enterprise applications. We found that programming challenges are usually related to APIs or libraries, including the complicated cross-language data handling of cryptography APIs, and the complex Java-based or XML-based approaches to configure Spring Security. In addition, we reported multiple security vulnerabilities in the suggested code of accepted answers on the StackOverfow forum. The vulnerabilities included disabling the default protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks, breaking SSL/TLS security through bypassing certificate validation, and using insecure cryptographic hash functions. Our findings reveal the insufficiency of secure coding assistance and documentation, as well as the huge gap between security theory and coding practices.},

We explore LLM applications across various domains, including hardware design security, intrusion detection, software engineering, design verification, cyber threat intelligence, malware detection, and phishing detection. We present an overview of LLM evolution and its current state, focusing on advancements in models such as GPT-4, GPT-3.5, Mixtral-8x7B, BERT, Falcon2, and LLaMA. Our analysis extends to LLM vulnerabilities, such as prompt injection, insecure output handling, data poisoning, DDoS attacks, and adversarial instructions. We delve into mitigation strategies to protect these models, providing a comprehensive look at potential attack scenarios and prevention techniques. Furthermore, we evaluate the performance of 42 LLM models in cybersecurity knowledge and hardware security, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses. We thoroughly evaluate cybersecurity datasets for LLM training and testing, covering the lifecycle from data creation to usage and identifying gaps for future research. In addition, we review new strategies for leveraging LLMs, including techniques like Half-Quadratic Quantization (HQQ), Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), Quantized Low-Rank Adapters (QLoRA), and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). These insights aim to enhance real-time cybersecurity defenses and improve the sophistication of LLM applications in threat detection and response. Our paper provides a foundational understanding and strategic direction for integrating LLMs into future cybersecurity frameworks, emphasizing innovation and robust model deployment to safeguard against evolving cyber threats.},

  abstract = {Programming language processing (similar to natural language processing) is a hot research topic in the field of software engineering; it has also aroused growing interest in the artificial intelligence community. However, different from a natural language sentence, a program contains rich, explicit, and complicated structural information. Hence, traditional NLP models may be inappropriate for programs. In this paper, we propose a novel tree-based convolutional neural network (TBCNN) for programming language processing, in which a convolution kernel is designed over programs' abstract syntax trees to capture structural information. TBCNN is a generic architecture for programming language processing; our experiments show its effectiveness in two different program analysis tasks: classifying programs according to functionality, and detecting code snippets of certain patterns. TBCNN outperforms baseline methods, including several neural models for NLP.},

  abstract = {Software vulnerability is one of the weaknesses in computer security that challenges developers to rectify. Software maintainers rely on code comments to maintain their source code, including fixing vulnerability issues. To facilitate understanding the security issues in the related code, vulnerability identifiers are commonly included in code comments. However, not all vulnerability-related code comments describe clearly the purposes of the inclusion of the identifiers. Based on this evidence, we investigate the importance of vulnerability identifiers contained in source code comments, which is the novelty of this paper. We performed a study of 1,491 code comments that refer to vulnerability identifiers to define their categories. We then applied a mixed-method approach to classifying the types of the related repository and code, the rationale of identifier references, and the severity level of vulnerabilities in the code. The results indicate that vulnerability identifiers in code comments are useful to notify security issues for the related source code, and our study widens up chances for future work to further investigate these problems.},

Recent work has shown tremendous success through an alternative way of creating developer tools, which we call neural software analysis. The key idea is to train a neural machine learning model on numerous code examples, which, once trained, makes predictions about previously unseen code. In contrast to traditional program analysis, neural software analysis naturally handles fuzzy information, such as coding conventions and natural language embedded in code, without relying on manually encoded heuristics. This article gives an overview of neural software analysis, discusses when to (not) use it, and presents three example analyses. The analyses address challenging software development problems: bug detection, type prediction, and code completion. The resulting tools complement and outperform traditional program analyses, and are used in industrial practice.},

To supplement existing labeled vulnerability datasets, we compiled a vast dataset of millions of open-source functions and labeled it with carefully-selected findings from three different static analyzers that indicate potential exploits. Using these datasets, we developed a fast and scalable vulnerability detection tool based on deep feature representation learning that directly interprets lexed source code.

  abstract = {As the demand for secure coding education grows, there is a need for improvements in how secure coding is taught and in preparing students to develop more secure software. As time in a Computer Science classroom is finite, educational efforts should be placed on targeting the most common types of vulnerabilities to better prepare students to avoid common security pitfalls in coding. Existing research in this area mainly focuses on developing vulnerability detection tools rather than analyzing the types of commonly produced vulnerabilities by students. Limited research exists in determining common student-produced vulnerabilities, and the available studies differ from the types of vulnerabilities that are researched in vulnerability detection literature. Our research works to further establish the types of vulnerabilities produced by students by using a static analysis tool on assignment code submissions in an undergraduate Programming II (CS2) course. We present our findings on what types of vulnerabilities are commonly produced by students and contrast them with what is commonly researched in the literature. We find there is little overlap between the vulnerability types reported by our study and other studies in the research area. This research has potential implications for secure coding education in a Computer Science curriculum. Further work should be done to establish the contexts in which specific vulnerability types are more likely to be produced and how to best teach students to avoid producing these vulnerabilities.},

Although many great models have been proposed, we do not yet have a good understanding of these models. This limits the further advancement of model robustness, debugging, and deployment for the vulnerability detection. In this paper, we surveyed and reproduced 9 state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep learning models on 2 widely used vulnerability detection datasets: Devign and MSR. We investigated 6 research questions in three areas, namely model capabilities, training data, and model interpretation. We experimentally demonstrated the variability between different runs of a model and the low agreement among different models' outputs. We investigated models trained for specific types of vulnerabilities compared to a model that is trained on all the vulnerabilities at once. We explored the types of programs DL may consider "hard" to handle. We investigated the relations of training data sizes and training data composition with model performance. Finally, we studied model interpretations and analyzed important features that the models used to make predictions. We believe that our findings can help better understand model results, provide guidance on preparing training data, and improve the robustness of the models.

Comments in code represent a main source for system documentation and are hence key for source code understanding with respect to development and maintenance. Although many software developers consider comments to be crucial for program understanding, existing approaches for software quality analysis ignore system commenting or make only quantitative claims. Hence, current quality analyzes do not take a significant part of the software into account. In this work, we present a first detailed approach for quality analysis and assessment of code comments. The approach provides a model for comment quality which is based on different comment categories. To categorize comments, we use machine learning on Java and C/C++ programs. The model comprises different quality aspects: by providing metrics tailored to suit specific categories, we show how quality aspects of the model can be assessed. The validity of the metrics is evaluated with a survey among 16 experienced software developers, a case study demonstrates the relevance of the metrics in practice.},

  abstract = {Despite various approaches being employed to detect vulnerabilities, the number of reported vulnerabilities shows an upward trend over the years. This suggests the problems are not caught before the code is released, which could be caused by many factors, like lack of awareness, limited efficacy of the existing vulnerability detection tools or the tools not being user-friendly. To help combat some issues with traditional vulnerability detection tools, we propose using large language models (LLMs) to assist in finding vulnerabilities in source code. LLMs have shown a remarkable ability to understand and generate code, underlining their potential in code-related tasks. The aim is to test multiple state-of-the-art LLMs and identify the best prompting strategies, allowing extraction of the best value from the LLMs. We provide an overview of the strengths and weaknesses of the LLM-based approach and compare the results to those of traditional static analysis tools. We find that LLMs can pinpoint many more issues than traditional static analysis tools, outperforming traditional tools in terms of recall and F1 scores. The results should benefit software developers and security analysts responsible for ensuring that the code is free of vulnerabilities.},

The model is evaluated by mapping assessment questions to the cognitive dimension of the revised Bloom's taxonomy. Experiments with students in four sections of CS0 and CS1 show that students using our modules perform significantly better at remembering, understanding and applying secure coding concepts. Students exposed to the modules also show increased ability to write code to address specific security issues.},

The financial impact of these vulnerabilities has been shown to exceed 380 million USD in industrial control systems alone. Since software developers write software, they also introduce these vulnerabilities into the source code. However, secure coding guidelines exist to prevent software developers from writing vulnerable code. This study focuses on the human factor, the software developer, and secure coding, in particular secure coding guidelines. We want to understand the software developers' awareness and compliance to secure coding guidelines and why, if at all, they aren't compliant or aware. We base our results on a large-scale survey on secure coding guidelines, with more than 190 industrial software developers. Our work's main contribution motivates the need to educate industrial software developers on secure coding guidelines, and it gives a list of fifteen actionable items to be used by practitioners in the industry.

  abstract = {In past and recent years, the issues related to managing technical debt received significant attention by researchers from both industry and academia. There are several factors that contribute to technical debt. One of these is represented by code bad smells, i.e., Symptoms of poor design and implementation choices. While the repercussions of smells on code quality have been empirically assessed, there is still only anecdotal evidence on when and why bad smells are introduced. To fill this gap, we conducted a large empirical study over the change history of 200 open source projects from different software ecosystems and investigated when bad smells are introduced by developers, and the circumstances and reasons behind their introduction. Our study required the development of a strategy to identify smell-introducing commits, the mining of over 0.5M commits, and the manual analysis of 9,164 of them (i.e., Those identified as smell-introducing). Our findings mostly contradict common wisdom stating that smells are being introduced during evolutionary tasks. In the light of our results, we also call for the need to develop a new generation of recommendation systems aimed at properly planning smell refactoring activities.},

  abstract = {Cybersecurity is now more important than ever, and so is education in this field. However, the cybersecurity domain encompasses an extensive set of concepts, which can be taught in different ways and contexts. To understand the state of the art of cybersecurity education and related research, we examine papers from the ACM SIGCSE and ACM ITiCSE conferences. From 2010 to 2019, a total of 1,748 papers were published at these conferences, and 71 of them focus on cybersecurity education. The papers discuss courses, tools, exercises, and teaching approaches. For each paper, we map the covered topics, teaching context, evaluation methods, impact, and the community of authors. We discovered that the technical topic areas are evenly covered (the most prominent being secure programming, network security, and offensive security), and human aspects, such as privacy and social engineering, are present as well. The interventions described in SIGCSE and ITiCSE papers predominantly focus on tertiary education in the USA. The subsequent evaluation mostly consists of collecting students' subjective perceptions via questionnaires. However, less than a third of the papers provide supplementary materials for other educators, and none of the authors published their dataset. Our results provide orientation in the area, a synthesis of trends, and implications for further research. Therefore, they are relevant for instructors, researchers, and anyone new in the field of cybersecurity education. The information we collected and synthesized from individual papers are organized in a publicly available dataset.},

The reuse of crowd-sourced code snippets can facilitate rapid prototyping. However, recent research shows that the shared code snippets may be of low quality and can even contain vulnerabilities. This paper aims to understand the nature and the prevalence of security vulnerabilities in crowd-sourced code examples. To achieve this goal, we investigate security vulnerabilities in the C++ code snippets shared on Stack Overflow over a period of 10 years. In collaborative sessions involving multiple human coders, we manually assessed each code snippet for security vulnerabilities following CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) guidelines. From the 72,483 reviewed code snippets used in at least one project hosted on GitHub, we found a total of 99 vulnerable code snippets categorized into 31 types. Many of the investigated code snippets are still not corrected on Stack Overflow. The 99 vulnerable code snippets found in Stack Overflow were reused in a total of 2859 GitHub projects. To help improve the quality of code snippets shared on Stack Overflow, we developed a browser extension that allows Stack Overflow users to be notified for vulnerabilities in code snippets when they see them on the platform.},

  abstract = {Software vulnerabilities can pose severe harms to a computing system. They can lead to system crash, privacy leakage, or even physical damage. Correctly identifying vulnerabilities among enormous software codes in a timely manner is so far the essential prerequisite to patch them. Unfortantely, the current vulnerability identification methods, either the classic ones or the deep-learning-based ones, have several critical drawbacks, making them unable to meet the present-day demands put forward by the software industry. To overcome the drawbacks, in this paper, we propose DeepVulSeeker, a novel fully automated vulnerability identification framework, which leverages both code graph structures and the semantic features with the help of the recently advanced Graph Representation Self-Attention and pre-training mechanisms. Our experiments show that DeepVulSeeker not only reaches an accuracy as high as 0.99 on traditional CWE datasets, but also outperforms all other exisiting methods on two highly-complicated datasets. We also testified DeepVulSeeker based on three case studies, and found that DeepVulSeeker is able to understand the implications of the vulnerbilities. We have fully implemented DeepVulSeeker and open-sourced it for future follow-up research.},

  abstract = {Deep learning is increasingly used as a building block of security systems. Unfortunately, neural networks are hard to interpret and typically opaque to the practitioner. The machine learning community has started to address this problem by developing methods for explaining the predictions of neural networks. While several of these approaches have been successfully applied in the area of computer vision, their application in security has received little attention so far. It is an open question which explanation methods are appropriate for computer security and what requirements they need to satisfy. In this paper, we introduce criteria for comparing and evaluating explanation methods in the context of computer security. These cover general properties, such as the accuracy of explanations, as well as security-focused aspects, such as the completeness, efficiency, and robustness. Based on our criteria, we investigate six popular explanation methods and assess their utility in security systems for malware detection and vulnerability discovery. We observe significant differences between the methods and build on these to derive general recommendations for selecting and applying explanation methods in computer security.},

Educators are also more aware of this situation and incorporate teaching security in their respective fields. An effective application of this is only possible by cultivating the teaching and learning perspectives. Understanding the security awareness and practice of students is useful as an initial step to create a baseline for teaching methods and content. In this paper, we first survey to investigate how students approach security and what could motivate them to learn and apply security practices. Then, we analyze the source code for 6 semesters of coding assignments for 2 tasks using a source code vulnerability analysis tool. In our analysis, we report the types of vulnerabilities and various aspects between them while incorporating the effect of student grades. We then explore the lexical and structural features of security in student code using data analysis and machine learning. For the lexical analysis, we build a classifier to extract informative features and for the structural analysis, we utilize Syntax Trees to represent code and perform clustering in terms of structural features where clusters themselves yield different vulnerability levels.},

  abstract = {Code summarization plays a pivotal role in the field of software engineering by offering developers a concise natural language comprehension of source code semantics. As software complexity continues to escalate, code summarization confronts various challenges, including discrepancies between source code and summarization, the absence of crucial or up-to-date information, and the inefficiency and resource demands of manual summarization. To address these challenges, Automatic Source Code Summarization (ASCS) has garnered widespread attention. This paper presents a comprehensive review and synthesis of ASCS research. It aims to provide an in-depth understanding of the core issues and challenges inherent in each phase of ASCS, illustrated with specific examples and application scenarios. Around of the core phases of ASCS including data collection, source code modeling, the generation of code summaries, and the assessment of their quality, the paper thoroughly compiles and assesses existing datasets, categorizes and examines prevalent source code modeling techniques, and delves into the methods for generating and evaluating the quality of code summaries. Concluding with an exploration of future research avenues and emerging trends, this paper serves as a guide for readers to grasp the cutting-edge developments in this field, enriched by the analysis of pivotal research contributions.},
