# TL;DR {.section background-color="#2288f5ff"}

## ***We propose a new tool and pedagogical approach to improve cybersecurity education.***

# Problem & Motivation {.section background-color="#2288f5ff"}

<!-- ## We Need to Improve Education in Developing Secure Code

- Software vulnerability exploitation remains a leading vector in breaches; secure coding must be integrated early [@verizonVerizon2023Data; @NISTSoftwareAssurance; @abetAccreditationChanges].  
- Existing static analyzers flag issues but rarely deliver **actionable, level-appropriate pedagogy** [@CWEFrequentlyAsked; @hazimhanifRiseSoftwareVulnerability2021].

## Prior Findings

- Vulnerabilities **increase and diversify** as students progress from CS1 → advanced courses [@sandersAnalysisSoftwareVulnerabilities2024].  
- Many CS programs lack sustained, program-wide security practice; students introduce vulnerabilities in routine coursework [@johnzorabedianVeracodeSurveyResearch; @sandersAnalysisSoftwareVulnerabilities2024; @sandersAssessingCommonSoftware2024].  
- Mismatch between vulnerabilities students actually produce and those emphasized in detection research [@sandersAssessingCommonSoftware2024; @yilmazUnderstandingSecurityVulnerabilities2022].  
- Time pressure & functionality-first norms drive insecure patterns; targeted feedback can help [@johnzorabedianVeracodeSurveyResearch; @yilmazUnderstandingSecurityVulnerabilities2022]. -->
  
## We Need to Improve Education in Developing Secure Code

> **Security failures start early.**  
> Students often learn to write code before they learn to write *secure* code.

- Software vulnerability exploitation remains a leading vector in breaches; secure coding must be integrated early [@verizonVerizon2023Data; @NISTSoftwareAssurance; @abetAccreditationChanges].  
- Teaching students to use static analyzers early is important, but is very difficult due to the complexity of the output of these tools. 
- Existing static analyzers flag issues but rarely deliver **actionable, level-appropriate pedagogy** [@CWEFrequentlyAsked; @hazimhanifRiseSoftwareVulnerability2021].

## Prior Findings: What We Know So Far

> **Empirical evidence supports this gap.**

- Vulnerabilities **increase and diversify** as students progress from CS1 → advanced courses [@sandersAnalysisSoftwareVulnerabilities2024].  
- Many CS programs lack sustained, program-wide security practice; students introduce vulnerabilities in routine coursework [@johnzorabedianVeracodeSurveyResearch; @sandersAnalysisSoftwareVulnerabilities2024; @sandersAssessingCommonSoftware2024].  
- Mismatch between vulnerabilities students actually produce and those emphasized in detection research [@sandersAssessingCommonSoftware2024; @yilmazUnderstandingSecurityVulnerabilities2022].  
- Time pressure & functionality-first norms drive insecure patterns; targeted feedback can help [@johnzorabedianVeracodeSurveyResearch; @yilmazUnderstandingSecurityVulnerabilities2022].


## Research Gap


- Need an **evidence-based, scalable mechanism** that:  
  - Grounds detection in a **truthful analyzer** [@CWEFrequentlyAsked]  
  - **Adapts feedback** to student level (beginner → advanced) [@sweller2019cognitive]  
  - Supports **longitudinal study** across multiple courses/institutions  
  - Collects telemetry for **learning analytics**


# Proposed Approach {.section background-color="#2288f5ff"}

## Pedalogical

- **Pedalogical** = Static Analysis (truth base) **+** LLM (tailored feedback)
  
  - Analyzer: SonarQube CE (CWE mapping) → issues & hotspots [@CWEFrequentlyAsked]  
  - LLM: transforms findings into **scaffolded, actionable guidance** (tailored levels) [@sweller2019cognitive]  

## System Pipeline

    A["Code Submission"] --> B["SonarQube Analysis<br/>(CWE mapping)"]
    B --> C["LLM Feedback<br/>(Level-appropriate)"]
    C --> D["Student View &<br/>Instructor Reports"]
```

<small>Grounded analyzer reduces hallucination risk; LLM provides audience-appropriate feedback.</small>

## Pedagogical Learning Theories

- Integrates proven learning theories into the system design to enhance the learning experience:
  
  - **Cognitive Load Theory** [@sweller2019cognitive]: convert verbose analyzer output → concise, relevant guidance (reduce extraneous load).
  - **Zone of Proximal Development** [@vygotsky1978mind]: feedback level aligned to course maturity (scaffolding).

## What Instructors Get

- Cohort dashboard: per-assignment vulnerability counts & trends.  
- Downloadable reports: analyzer findings, prompts/responses, submission diffs.  
- Configurable **feedback detail level** for scaffolding.

## Proposed Study Context

- Multi-course, multi-institutional.
- Undergraduate courses (intro → advanced; multiple sections; in-person & online).
- Incentivized via **bonus points** contingent on meeting minimum functionality and reducing vulnerabilities.  

## Data & Measures

- **Static analysis artifacts:** CWE-tagged vulnerabilities, security hotspots, bugs, code smells.  
- **Engagement telemetry:** time on feedback, resubmission frequency, interaction with explanations.  
- **Learning signals:** pre/post patterns across assignments; regression models of engagement → reduction.  
- **Qualitative:** end-of-semester survey on usefulness & strategies.

## Analysis Plan

- Longitudinal within-course and cross-course comparisons.  
- Regression modeling: engagement metrics → vulnerability change.  
- Category-level success: which CWE types improve most?  
- Sensitivity to bonus-point variability across courses (limitations acknowledged).

## Expected Contributions

- A **replicable pipeline** for secure-coding feedback integrated into non-security courses.  
- Evidence that **grounded LLM feedback** can reduce vulnerabilities and shape habits .  
- A platform for **program-level learning analytics** on secure coding.

## Anticipated Threats & Limitations

- Bonus-point schemes differ across courses → potential confounds.  
- Structured prompts mitigate LLM variability, but do not eliminate it [@shenChatGPT2023].  

# Encouraging Early Analysis {.section background-color="#2288f5ff"}

## Pedalogical in a CS2 (Data Structures) Course

- Students designed and selected data structures for a medium-sized programming project.
- Experimental group used the Pedalogical chatbot for guided reasoning and scaffolding, while the control group used a generic ChatGPT-4.0 wrapper, enabling comparison of design quality, reasoning depth, and tool engagement.
- Students in the experimental group performed significantly better on project outcomes, suggesting increased metacognitive awareness and problem-solving strategies based on rubric-based grading.

## Call to Action

- Adopt Pedalogical in non-security courses to **normalize secure coding**.  
- Collaborate on **cross-institutional studies** and shared analytics.  
- Extend to additional languages & rulesets; explore adaptive feedback policies.
